# Implementation of the ElGamal Cryptosystem

# DESCRIPTION AND IMPLEMENTATION
#
# This python program implements the ElGamal cryptosystem.  The program is capable of both
# encrypting and decrypting a message.  At execution the user will be prompted for three things:
#       1) a number n which specifies the length of the prime to be generated
#       2) a number t which specifies the desired confidence that the generated prime
#       is actually prime
#       3) the name of a file that contains the message he wishes to encrypt and decrypt
#
# After the user has provided the necessary information the program will generate a pair
# of keys (K1, K2) used for encryption and decryption.  K1 is the public key and contains
# three integers (p, g, h).
#       p is an n bit prime.  The probability that p is actually prime is 1-(2^-t)
#       g is the square of a primitive root mod p
#       h = g^x mod p; x is randomly chosen, 1 <= x < p
# h is computed using fast modular exponentiation, implemented as modexp( base, exp, modulus )
# K2 is the private key and contains three integers (p, g, x) that are described above.
# K1 and K2 are written to files named K1 and K2.
#
# Next the program encodes the bytes of the message into integers z[i] < p.
# The module for this is named encode() and is described further where it is implemented.
#
# After the message has been encoded into integers, the integers are encrypted and written
# to a file, Ciphertext.  The encryption procedure is implemented in encrypt().  It works
# as follows:
#       Each corresponds to a pair (c, d) that is written to Ciphertext.
#       For each integer z[i]:
#               c[i] = g^y (mod p).  d[i] = z[i]h^y (mod p)
#               where y is chosen randomly, 0 <= y < p
#
# The decryption module decrypt() reads each pair of integers from Ciphertext and converts
# them back to encoded integers.  It is implemented as follows:
#       s = c[i]^x (mod p)
#       z[i] = d[i]*s^-1 (mod p)
#
# The decode() module takes the integers produced from the decryption module and separates
# them into the bytes received in the initial message.  These bytes are written to the file
# Plaintext.
#
# HURDLES CLEARED DURING IMPLEMENTATION
#
# modular exponentiation
# The first problem I encountered was in implementing the fast modular exponentiator, modexp().
# At first it did not terminate when given a negative number.  I quickly figured out that when
# performing integer division on negative numbers, the result is rounded down rather than toward
# zero.
#
# finding primitive roots
# Understanding the definition of primitive roots was not enough to find one efficiently.  I had
# search the web to understand how primitive roots can be found.  Wikipedia helped me understand
# I needed to test potential primitive roots multiplicative order.  The algorithm found at
# http://modular.math.washington.edu/edu/2007/spring/ent/ent-html/node31.html
# is the one I implemented.
#
# finding large prime numbers
# After implementing the Solovay-Strassen primality test I found it was difficult to compute 100
# bit primes even with probability 1/2.  I met with Professor Klapper to discuss this problem and he
# suggested I quit running the program on UK's shared "multilab" and I speed up my Jacobi algorithm
# by using branches to find powers of -1 rather than actually exponentiating them.  After doing this
# I was able to find 500 bit primes in about 15 minutes.
#
# finding prime numbers with confidence > 2
# I found it took a long time to test primes with a large number of bits with confidence greater than
# two.  I went to the web again to read over the description of the Solovay-Strassen primality test
# and realized jacobi(a, n) should be congruent to modexp(a, (n-1)/2, n) mod n.  I had only been checking
# that they were equal.  Before making this change I tried to find a 200 bit prime with confidence 100
# and gave up after an hour and a half.  After this change I was able to succeed after a couple of minutes.
#
# getting encoding and decoding to work
# I knew that encoding and decoding were implemented correctly because I could encode and decode a message
# and get the message I had started with.  But I did not receive the right message when I encrypted and
# decrypted it, despite having checked my encrypt and decrypt modules many times.  I fixed this by raising
# s to p-2 instead of -1 in the decryption function.
